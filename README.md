# Moving blocks (hard) ⬇️➡️⬅️⬆️

## Learning objectives

- Create Grid
- Place elements
- Move DOM elements on the page
- React to key-presses to move through the grid and select *
- Collision detection 

## The Mission

Have a square that you can move using the arrow keys.
Have 4 other squares that move randomly around the screen. *
When the player square hits the other squares he loses a life (3 lives) and when all his lives are gone he loses the game.
Show the time since the start how long he survived.

### Must-have features

- Square that can be controlled
- Chasing squares *
- Live mechanic

### Nice-to-have features

- Graphics instead of squares
- How a visual timer to show the time that has elapsed
- Make "food" squares spawn that give an extra life when picked up
- Make a "god" square that makes the user immortal for the enemy squares.
- Maybe over time spawn more enemy squares.
- Go crazy
